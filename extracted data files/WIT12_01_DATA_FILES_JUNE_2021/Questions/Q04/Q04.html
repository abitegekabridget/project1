            <img src="assets/image1.jpg" alt="Bee on a flower" class="img-left">
            <p>Bees are essential to our ecosystem. They pollinate plants, ensuring food production and biodiversity. Without them, many species would struggle to survive.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Facing Bees</h2>
            <p>Climate change, habitat loss, and pesticides have led to a decline in bee populations.</p>

            <p>Efforts are being made worldwide to protect and conserve bee populations. Planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, and supporting local beekeepers can all help.</p>
